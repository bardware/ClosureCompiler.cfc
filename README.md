# ClosureCompiler.cfc - A ColdFusion Facade For Google's Closure Compiler

by [Ben Nadel][1]

### Note About CFScript Tags

The ColdFusion components in this project as written using CFScript tags.
These tags are not required for the ColdFusion component to compile and
work properly. I have included them because they make the color-coding work
properly in GitHub. Please feel free to remove them if you like.
